# Instrumentation-of-a-digital-thermometer-using-PIC-microcontroller-and-thermistor

The use of bridge circuit is very familiar as a transducer in temperature measuring device. In one of the arm of the bridge temperature sensing resistor called thermistor is used in order to make change in the voltage level across the thermistor with the change of temperature. In the left arm two 21 kilo-ohm and a thermistor is connected where in the right arm two 10 kilo-ohm resistor is connected. The   voltage across the thermistor is implied on the inverting input of the instrument amplifier AD620 and the 10 kilo-ohm resistor on the right arm is non-inverting input. The resistive value of the thermistor varies from 640 ohm to 42 kilo ohm(approximate) with respective change of temperature from 0 degree centigrade to 100 degree centigrade. So, when it is 0 degree centigrade the AD-620,instrument amplifier, output gives negligible value because voltage, applied to common point of both bridge arm, dividing equally between two 21k resistors and thermistor and so between two 10k resistors. On the other hand, when it is  100 degree centigrade, the output of the instrument amplifier is maximum. this voltage level is read in analog manner by using microcontroller analog pin. Then, A program is developed using the change in voltage level with respect to temperature with a view to measuring temperature. This value is digital write in RB port of microcontroller and is displayed using a LCD display.
